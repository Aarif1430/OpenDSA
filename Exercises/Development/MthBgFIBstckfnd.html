      <p class="question">An investor places <var>N</var>,000 into a stock fund. 10 years later the account has a value of <var>M</var>,000. Using logarithms and  antilogarithms, determine the average annual growth rate for this fund.(Round to the nearest two digits) </p>
      <p class="solution" data-type="text">1.15</p>
      <div class="hints">
       <p> If you start with N and in 10 years you get M, then you want to solve for X in the equation  N * X^10 = M.</p>
       <p> You will need to use logs/antilogs. Fortunately, you can use whatever base you want for the logarithm. Since many calculators will
calculate the natural log (base e) and will also give you e^x, this might be the easiest base to work with.</p>

<p> Solving for X gives us:
10 ln X = ln M/N </ br>
ln X = (ln M/N)/10</ br>
X = e^((ln M/N)/10)</p>
