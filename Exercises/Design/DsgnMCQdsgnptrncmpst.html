      <p class="question"> The composite design pattern is most
      appropriate when:</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>"We are likely to modify the program to add new object types, but the basic operations stay the same."</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
	<li><var>"We are likely to modify the program to add new operations, but the basic object types stay the same."</var> </li>
	<li><var>"We need to encapulate and make interchangeable a set of alternative actions that might be performed as part of some larger activity."</var></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
        <p>The standard "tree in control" design is good when we need
          to add operations to an unchanging class hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Composite is not about interchangeable actions.</p>
        <p>In contrast to "tree in control", composite is good when
          the class hierarchy is likely to change.</p>
