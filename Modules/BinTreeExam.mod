<ODSAsettitle>Binary Tree Chapter Exam</ODSAsettitle>
<ODSAprereq "BinTree" \>

<p>
This module contains "end of chapter" questions to review things
related to the whole chapter. Need to figure out what the proper set
of prereqs is.
</p>

<p class="TODO">
Exercise:
Show a tree. Ask if it is a BST, a heap, or neither.
</p>

<p class = "TODO">
Exercise:
Randomly select a problem from any of the exercises from this
chapter. Need to be careful that the selection is limited to modules
that were actually selected for this instantiation of the book, so
the exercise logic has to verify that dynamically.
