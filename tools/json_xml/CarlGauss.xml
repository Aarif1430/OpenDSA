He was born in Brunswick, Germany on April 30, 1777.
Gauss was a child prodigy, who was reported as able to perform long computations in
his head. At age 10 he studied algebra and analysis.
He made his first fundamental discoveries while still a teenager.
Among these was the <reference name="least squares" refuri="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least squares</reference><target ids="least-squares" names="least\ squares" refuri="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares"></target>
method for handling statistical data and a proof
that a regular 17-sided polygon can be constructed with only a straightedge and a compass.
This was the first result of its kind since discoveries by the Greeks 2,000 years earlier.</paragraph><paragraph>He completed his monumental book on number theory, <emphasis>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</emphasis>
in 1798 at the age of 21 .
It summarized previous work in a systematic way and introducing many fundamental ideas of his own.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1801, the same year <emphasis>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</emphasis> was published, the asteroid Ceres was observed by
astronomers.  Unfortunately, they could only make observations across 3 degrees of the sky
before it was obscured by the sun.
Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it:
the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant
amount of data  three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.
In what seemed a superhuman feat at the time, Gauss used the available data to calculate
the orbit of Ceres.
As part of his work, he showed that experimental data varies within a bell-shaped curve,
now called the <reference name="Gaussian distribution" refuri="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Gaussian distribution</reference><target ids="gaussian-distribution" names="gaussian\ distribution" refuri="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"></target>.
This achievement established his reputation as a genius before the age of 25.</paragraph><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><index>null</index></raw><paragraph>Gauss also developed tables of logarithms now known as
<reference name="Gaussian logarithms" refuri="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_number_system">Gaussian logarithms</reference><target ids="gaussian-logarithms" names="gaussian\ logarithms" refuri="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_number_system"></target>.</paragraph><paragraph>Gaussian logarithms are designed to facilitate finding the common logarithm of a
sum or difference of two numbers whose common logarithms are known.
The object of a table of Gaussian logarithms, sometimes known as Addition and Subtraction Logarithms,
is to give <math>\log (a \pm b)</math> by single entry when <math>\log a</math> and <math>\log b</math> are known.</paragraph><paragraph>When Gauss died, many unpublished notes and manuscripts were found in his desk.
When his complete <emphasis>Collected Works</emphasis> were finally published later,
it had taken a group of scientists nearly seventy years to review and edit his writings.</paragraph><paragraph>Today Gauss's name occurs in many places in mathematics and science:</paragraph><bullet_list bullet="-"><list_item><paragraph>The normal probability distribution as also called the Gaussian curve or distribution</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Gauss's Laws for

In Brunswick, there is a statue of him.
Its base is, appropriately, a 17 pointed star.</paragraph><footnote auto="1" backrefs="id2" ids="id3" names="1"><label>1</label><paragraph>Gottlieb Biermann, <emphasis>Portrait of Carl Friedrich Gauss</emphasis>
