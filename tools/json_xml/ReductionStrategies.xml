selected <math>\lambda</math> expression, that is, perform as many
<math>\beta</math>-reductions as it takes until a <math>\beta</math>-normal form
is reached. For this problem, you must use the <emphasis>applicative-order</emphasis>
reduction strategy. To get credit for this problem, you only need to
solve one problem instance correctly. However, each problem
instance contains several steps that you must perform correctly (in
this case, each step is a <math>\beta</math>-reduction). Read and follow
the directions carefully. Note that the correct answer (called the
<emphasis>model answer</emphasis>) is available. However, if you look it up, you will not
get credit for the current problem instance. To get another chance for
credit, start a new problem instance by clicking the <emphasis>Reset</emphasis> button.</paragraph><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><avembed
