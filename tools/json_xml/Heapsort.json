sorting methods and will\nbe slower than Quicksort or Mergesort due to the relative expense of\ninserting values into the tree.\nThere is also the possibility that the BST might be unbalanced,\nleading to a  worst-case running time.\nSubtree balance in the BST is closely related to Quicksort's partition\nstep.\nQuicksort's pivot serves roughly the same purpose as the BST root\nvalue in that the left partition (subtree) stores values less than\nthe pivot (root) value, while the right partition (subtree) stores\nvalues greater than or equal to the pivot (root)."}, "A good sorting algorithm can be devised based on a tree structure more\nsuited to the purpose.\nIn particular, we would like the tree to be balanced, space efficient,\nand fast.\nThe algorithm should take advantage of the fact that sorting is a\nspecial-purpose application in that all of the values to be stored are\navailable at the start.\nThis means that we do not necessarily need to insert one value at a\ntime into the tree structure.", {"title_reference": ["Heapsort", "heap <heap> <Heaps>", "external sorting <external sort> <ExternalSort>"], "literal": "buildheap", "math": "\\Theta(n \\log
