But once
you learn to use the power of pointers, you can never go back. There are too many things
that can only be done with pointers. But with increased power comes increased
responsibility. Pointers allow new and more ugly types of bugs, and pointer bugs can
crash in random ways which makes them more difficult to debug. Nonetheless, even with
their problems, pointers are an irresistibly powerful programming construct. (The
following explanation uses the C language syntax where a syntax is required; there is a
discussion of Java at the section.)</paragraph><paragraph>Pointers solve two common software problems. First, pointers allow different sections of
code to share information easily. You can get the same effect by copying information
back and forth, but pointers solve the problem better. Second, pointers enable complex
linked data structures like linked lists and binary trees.</paragraph><paragraph>Simple <literal>int</literal> and <literal>float</literal> variables operate pretty intuitively. An
<literal>int</literal> variable is like a box which can store a single <literal>int</literal> value such
as 42. In a drawing, a simple variable is a box with its current value
drawn inside.</paragraph><target refid="num42fig"></target><raw format="xml" ids="num42fig" names="num42fig" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw><paragraph>A pointer works a little differently, it does not store
a simple value directly. Instead, a pointer stores a <title_reference>reference</title_reference> to another value.
The variable the pointer refers to is sometimes known as its <title_reference>pointee</title_reference>.
In a drawing, a pointer is a box which contains the beginning of an arrow which leads
to its pointee. (There is no single, official, word for
the concept of a pointee  pointee is just the word used in these
explanations.)</paragraph><paragraph>The following drawing shows two variables: <literal>num</literal> and <literal>numPtr</literal>. The simple variable <literal>num</literal>
contains the value 42 in the usual way. The variable numPtr is a pointer which contains
a reference to the variable num. The <literal>numPtr</literal> variable is the pointer and <literal>num</literal> is its
pointee. What is stored inside of <literal>numPtr</literal>? Its value is not an <literal>int</literal>. Its value is a
reference to an <literal>int</literal>.</paragraph><target refid="numnumptrfig"></target><raw format="xml" ids="numnumptrfig" names="numnumptrfig" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw></section><section ids="pointer-reference-and-dereference" names="pointer\ reference\ and\ dereference"><title>Pointer Reference and Dereference</title><paragraph>The <title_reference>dereference</title_reference> operation follows a pointer's reference to get
the value of its pointee.
The value of the dereference of <literal>numPtr</literal> above is 42. When the dereference operation is
used correctly, it's simple. It just accesses the value of the pointee. The only restriction is
that the pointer must have a pointee for the dereference to access. Almost all bugs in
pointer code involve violating that one restriction. A pointer must be assigned a pointee
before dereference operations will work.</paragraph><paragraph>The constant NULL is a special pointer value which encodes the idea of
"points to nothing".
It turns out to be convenient to have a well defined pointer value
which represents the idea that a pointer does not have a pointee.
It is a runtime error to dereference a NULL pointer.
In drawings, the value NULL is usually drawn as a diagonal
line between the corners of the pointer variable's box.</paragraph><target refid="numptrnullfig"></target><raw format="xml" ids="numptrnullfig" names="numptrnullfig" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw><paragraph>The C language uses the symbol NULL for this purpose.
NULL is equal to the integer constant 0, so NULL can play the role of a boolean
false. Official C++ no longer uses the NULL symbolic constant  use the integer constant 0 directly.
Java uses the symbol null.</paragraph></section><section ids="pointer-assignment" names="pointer\ assignment"><title>Pointer Assignment</title><paragraph>The assignment operation (<literal>=</literal>) between two pointers makes them point to the same
pointee. It's a simple rule for a potentially complex situation, so it is worth repeating:
assigning one pointer to another makes them point to the same thing. The example below
adds a second pointer, <literal>second</literal>, assigned with the statement <literal>second = numPtr;</literal>.
The result is that second points to the same pointee as numPtr. In the drawing, this
means that the second and numPtr boxes both contain arrows pointing to <literal>num</literal>.
Assignment between pointers does not change or even touch the pointees. It just changes
which pointee a pointer refers to.</paragraph><target refid="numptrsecondlfig"></target><raw format="xml" ids="numptrsecondlfig" names="numptrsecondlfig" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw><paragraph>After assignment, the <literal>==</literal> test comparing the two pointers will return true. For example
<literal>(second==numPtr)</literal> above is true. The assignment operation also works with the
NULL value. An assignment operation with a NULL pointer copies the NULL value
from one pointer to another.</paragraph><paragraph>Memory drawings are the key to thinking about pointer code.
When you are looking at code, thinking about how it will use memory at
run time, then make a quick drawing to work out your ideas.
This tutorial certainly uses drawings to show how pointers work.
That's the way to do it.</paragraph><section ids="sharing" names="sharing"><title>Sharing</title><paragraph>Two pointers which both refer to a single pointee are said to be
"sharing".
That two or more entities can cooperatively share a single memory
structure is a key advantage of pointers in all computer
languages.
Pointer manipulation is just technique  sharing is
often the real goal.
Later we will see how sharing can be used to provide efficient
communication between parts of a program.</paragraph></section><section ids="shallow-and-deep-copying" names="shallow\ and\ deep\ copying"><title>Shallow and Deep Copying</title><paragraph>In particular, sharing can enable communication between two functions. One function
passes a pointer to the value of interest to another function. Both functions can access the
value of interest, but the value of interest itself is not copied.
This communication is called <title_reference>shallow copy</title_reference> since instead of
making and sending a (large) copy of the value of
interest, a (small) pointer is sent and the value of interest is shared. The recipient needs to
understand that they have a shallow copy, so they know not to change or delete it since it
is shared. The alternative where a complete copy is made and sent is
known as a <title_reference>deep copy</title_reference>.
Deep copies are simpler in a way, since each function can change their copy
without interfering with the other copy, but deep copies run slower because of all the
copying.
The drawing below shows shallow and deep copying between two functions, A() and B().
In the shallow case, the smiley face is shared by passing a pointer between the two. In the
deep case, the smiley face is copied, and each function gets their own.</paragraph><target refid="shallowdeepfig"></target><raw format="xml" ids="shallowdeepfig" names="shallowdeepfig" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw><paragraph>The next module will explain the above sharing technique in detail.</paragraph></section></section><section ids="bad-pointers" names="bad\ pointers"><title>Bad Pointers</title><paragraph>When a pointer is first allocated, it does not have a pointee.
The pointer is <title_reference>uninitialized</title_reference> or simply "bad".
A dereference operation on a bad pointer is a serious runtime error.
If you are lucky, the dereference operation will crash or halt
immediately (Java behaves this way).
If you are unlucky, the bad pointer dereference will corrupt a random
area of memory, slightly altering the operation of the program so that
it goes wrong some indefinite time later.
Each pointer must be assigned a pointee before it can support
dereference operations. Before that, the pointer is bad and must not
be used.
In our memory drawings, the bad pointer value is shown with an XXX
value.</paragraph><target refid="numptrxxxfig"></target><raw format="xml" ids="numptrxxxfig" names="numptrxxxfig" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw><paragraph>Bad pointers are very common. In fact,  <strong>every pointer starts out with a bad value</strong>.
Correct code overwrites the bad value with a correct reference to a pointee, and thereafter
the pointer works fine. There is nothing automatic that gives a pointer a valid pointee.</paragraph><paragraph>Quite the opposite  most languages make it easy to omit this important step. You just
have to program carefully. If your code is crashing, a bad pointer should be your first
suspicion.
Pointers in dynamic languages such as Perl, LISP, and Java work a little differently. The
run-time system sets each pointer to NULL when it is allocated and checks it each time it
is dereferenced. So code can still exhibit pointer bugs, but they will halt politely on the
offending line instead of crashing haphazardly like C. As a result, it is much easier to
locate and fix pointer bugs in dynamic languages. The run-time checks are also a reason
why such languages always run at least a little slower than a compiled language like C or
C++.</paragraph><paragraph>One way to think about pointer code is that operates at two levels  pointer level and
pointee level. The trick is that <strong>both</strong> levels need to be initialized and connected for things
to work. (1) the pointer must be allocated, (1) the pointee must be allocated, and (3) the
pointer must be assigned to point to the pointee. It's rare to forget step (1). But forget (2)
or (3), and the whole thing will blow up at the first dereference. Remember to account for
both levels  make a memory drawing during your design to make sure it's right.</paragraph></section><section ids="syntax" names="syntax"><title>Syntax</title><paragraph>The above basic features of pointers, pointees, dereferencing, and
assigning are the only concepts you need to build pointer code.
However, in order to talk about pointer code, we need to use a known
syntax which is about as interesting as... a syntax.
We will use the Java language syntax which has the advantage that it
has influenced the syntaxes of several languages.</paragraph><section ids="pointer-type-syntax" names="pointer\ type\ syntax"><title>Pointer Type Syntax</title><paragraph>A pointer type in C is just the pointee type followed by an asterisk (*).</paragraph><paragraph><literal>int*</literal>  type: pointer to <literal>int</literal></paragraph><paragraph><literal>float*</literal> type: pointer to <literal>float</literal></paragraph><paragraph><literal>struct fraction*</literal> type: pointer to <literal>struct fraction</literal></paragraph><paragraph><literal>struct fraction**</literal> type: <literal>pointer to struct fraction*</literal></paragraph></section><section ids="pointer-variables" names="pointer\ variables"><title>Pointer Variables</title><paragraph>Pointer variables are declared just like any other variable.
The declaration gives the type and name of the new variable and
reserves memory to hold its value.
The declaration does not assign a pointee for the pointer  the
pointer starts out with a bad value.</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">int* numPtr; // Declare the int* (pointer to int) variable numPtr.
             // This allocates space for the pointer, but not the pointee.

for storing in a pointer.
The simplest way is the &amp; operator.
The &amp; operator can go to the left of any variable,
and it computes a reference to that variable.
The code below uses a pointer and
an &amp; to produce the earlier <literal>num/numPtr</literal> example.</paragraph><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw><literal_block xml:space="preserve">void NumPtrExample() {

 }</literal_block><paragraph>It is possible to use &amp; in a way which compiles fine but which creates
problems at run time.
The full discussion of how to correctly use &amp; is in the next module.
For now we will just use &amp; in a simple way.</paragraph></section><section ids="the-operator-dereference" names="the\ *\ operator\ dereference"><title>The * Operator  Dereference</title><paragraph>The star operator (*) dereferences a pointer.

above correct code, but without the middle step where the pointers are
assigned pointees.
The bad code will compile fine, but at run-time, each dereference with
a bad pointer will corrupt memory in some way.
The program will crash sooner or later.
It is up to the programmer to ensure that each pointer is assigned a
pointee before it is used.
The following example shows a simple example of the bad code and a
drawing of how memory is likely to react.</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">void BadPointer() {

In Java, simple data types such as <literal>int</literal> and <literal>char</literal> operate just as in C. More complex types
such as arrays and objects are automatically implemented using pointers. The language
automatically uses pointers behind the scenes for such complex types, and no pointer
specific syntax is required. The programmer just needs to realize that operations like
<literal>a=b;</literal> will automatically be implemented with pointers if a and b are arrays or objects. Or
put another way, the programmer needs to remember that assignments and parameters
with arrays and objects are intrinsically shallow or shared  see the Deep vs. Shallow
material above. The following code shows some Java object references. Notice that there
are no <literal>*</literal>'s or <literal>&amp;</literal>'s in the code to create pointers. The code
intrinsically uses pointers.
Also, the garbage collector takes care of the deallocation
automatically at the end of the function.</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">public void JavaShallow() {
  Foo a = new Foo();
  // Create a Foo object (no * in the declaration)
  Foo b = new Foo();
  // Create another Foo object
  b=a;
  // This is automatically a shallow assignment --
  // a and b now refer to the same object.
  a.Bar();
  // This could just as well be written b.Bar();
  // There is no memory leak here -- the garbage collector
  // will automatically recycle the memory for the two objects.
}</literal_block><paragraph>The Java approach has two main features.</paragraph><bullet_list bullet="*"><list_item><paragraph>Fewer bugs. Because the language implements the pointer manipulation
accurately and automatically, the most common pointer bug  are no
longer possible, Yay! Also, the Java runtime system checks each
pointer value every time it is used,  so NULL pointer dereferences
are caught immediately on the line where they occur. This can make a
programmer much more productive.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Slower. Because the language takes responsibility for implementing
so much pointer machinery at runtime, Java code runs slower than the
equivalent C code. (There are other reasons for Java to run slowly
as well. There is active research in making Java faser in
interesting ways  the Sun "Hot Spot" project.) In any case, the
appeal of increased programmer efficiency and fewer bugs makes the
slowness worthwhile for some  applications.</paragraph></list_item></bullet_list></section><section ids="how-are-pointers-implemented-in-the-machine" names="how\ are\ pointers\ implemented\ in\ the\ machine?"><title>How Are Pointers Implemented In The Machine?</title><paragraph>How are pointers implemented?
The short explanation is that every area of memory in the
machine has a numeric address like 1000 or 20452.
A pointer to an area of memory is really just an integer which is
storing the address of that area of memory. The dereference
operation looks at the address, and goes to that area of memory to retrieve the pointee
stored there. Pointer assignment just copies the numeric address from one pointer to
another. The NULL value is generally just the numeric address 0  the computer just
never allocates a pointee at 0 so that address can be used to represent NULL. A bad
pointer is really just a pointer which contains a random address  just like an
uninitialized <literal>int</literal> variable which starts out with a random <literal>int</literal> value. The pointer has not
yet been assigned the specific address of a valid pointee. This is why dereference operations with bad pointers are so unpredictable. They operate on whatever random area
of memory they happen to have the address of.</paragraph></section><section ids="the-term-reference" names="the\ term\ 'reference'"><title>The Term 'Reference'</title><paragraph>The word <title_reference>reference</title_reference> means almost the same thing as the word
"pointer".
The difference is that "reference" tends to be used in a discussion of
pointer issues which is not specific to any particular language or
implementation.
The word "pointer" connotes the common C/C++ implementation of
pointers as addresses.
The word "reference" is also used in the phrase
<title_reference>reference parameter</title_reference>
which is a technique that uses pointer parameters for two-way
communication between functions.
This technique is the subject of a later module.</paragraph></section><section ids="why-are-bad-pointer-bugs-so-common" names="why\ are\ bad\ pointer\ bugs\ so\ common?"><title>Why Are Bad Pointer Bugs So Common?</title><paragraph>Why is it so often the case that programmers will allocate a pointer,
but forget to set it to refer to a pointee?
The rules for pointers don't seem that complex, yet every programmer
makes this error repeatedly.
Why?
The problem is that we are trained by the tools we use.
Simple variables don't require any extra setup.
You can allocate a simple variable, such as <literal>int</literal>
, and use it immediately. All that <literal>int</literal>, <literal>char</literal>, struct fraction code you have written has trained you, quite reasonably,
that a variable may be used once it is declared. Unfortunately, pointers look like simple variables but they require the extra initialization
before use. It's unfortunate, in a way, that pointers happen look like other variables, since
it makes it easy to forget that the rules for their use are very different. Oh well. Try to
remember to assign your pointers to refer to pointees. Don't be surprised when you forget.</paragraph></section></document>
