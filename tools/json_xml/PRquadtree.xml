(hereafter referred to as the <title_reference>PR quadtree</title_reference>)
each node either has exactly four children or is a leaf.
That is, the PR quadtree is a full four-way branching
(4-ary) tree in shape.
The PR quadtree represents a collection of data points in two
dimensions by decomposing the region containing the data points
into four equal quadrants, subquadrants, and so on, until no leaf node
contains more than a single point.
In other words, if a region contains zero or one data points, then it
is represented by a PR quadtree consisting of a single leaf node.
If the region contains more than a single data point, then the region
is split into four equal quadrants.
The corresponding PR quadtree then contains an internal node and four
subtrees, each subtree representing a single quadrant of the region,
which might in turn be split into subquadrants.
Each internal node of a PR quadtree represents a single split
of the two-dimensional region.
The four quadrants of the region (or equivalently, the corresponding
subtrees) are designated (in order) NW, NE, SW, and~SE.
Each quadrant containing more than a single point would
in turn be recursively divided into subquadrants until each leaf of
the corresponding PR quadtree contains at most one point.</paragraph><target refid="prexamp"></target><raw format="xml" ids="prexamp" names="prexamp" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw><paragraph>For example, consider the region of Figure <title_reference>Figure #PRExamp</title_reference> (a)
and the corresponding PR quadtree in
Figure <title_reference>Figure #PRExamp</title_reference> (b).
The decomposition process demands a fixed key range.
In this example, the region is assumed to be of size
<math>128 \times 128</math>.
Note that the internal nodes of the PR quadtree are used solely to
indicate decomposition of the region; internal nodes do not store data
records.
Because the decomposition lines are predetermined (i.e, key-space
decomposition is used), the PR quadtree is a trie.</paragraph><paragraph>Search for a record matching point <math>Q</math> in the PR quadtree is
straightforward.
Beginning at the root, we continuously branch to the quadrant that
contains <math>Q</math> until our search reaches a leaf node.
If the root is a leaf, then just check to see if the node's data
record matches point <math>Q</math>.
If the root is an internal node, proceed to the child that contains
the search coordinate.
For example, the NW quadrant of Figure <title_reference>Figure #PRExamp</title_reference> contains
points whose <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> values each fall in the range 0 to 63.
The NE quadrant contains points whose <math>x</math> value falls in the range
64 to 127, and whose <math>y</math> value falls in the range 0 to 63.
If the root's child is a leaf node, then that child is checked to see
if <math>Q</math> has been found.
If the child is another internal node, the search process continues
through the tree until a leaf node is found.
If this leaf node stores a record whose position matches <math>Q</math> then
the query is successful; otherwise <math>Q</math> is not in the tree.</paragraph><paragraph>Inserting record <math>P</math> into the PR quadtree is performed by first
locating the leaf node that contains the location of <math>P</math>.
If this leaf node is empty, then <math>P</math> is stored at this
leaf.
If the leaf already contains <math>P</math> (or a record with <math>P</math>'s
coordinates), then a duplicate record should be reported.
If the leaf node already contains another record, then the node
must be repeatedly decomposed until the existing record and <math>P</math>
fall into different leaf nodes.
Figure <title_reference>Figure #PRinsert</title_reference> shows an example of such an insertion.</paragraph><target refid="prinsert"></target><raw format="xml" ids="prinsert" names="prinsert" xml:space="preserve"><odsafig>null</odsafig></raw><paragraph>Deleting a record <math>P</math> is performed by first locating the
node <math>N</math> of the PR quadtree that contains <math>P</math>.
Node <math>N</math> is then changed to be empty.
The next step is to look at <math>N</math>'s three siblings.
<math>N</math> and its siblings must be merged together to form a single
node <math>N'</math> if only one point is contained among them.
This merging process continues until some level is reached at which
at least two points are contained in the subtrees represented by
node <math>N'</math> and its siblings.
For example, if point <math>C</math> is to be deleted from the PR quadtree
representing Figure <title_reference>Figure #PRinsert</title_reference> (b), the resulting node must
be merged with its siblings, and that larger node again merged with
its siblings to restore the PR quadtree to the decomposition of
Figure <title_reference>Figure #PRinsert</title_reference> (a).</paragraph><paragraph>Region search is easily performed with the PR quadtree.
To locate all points within radius <math>r</math> of query
point <math>Q</math>, begin at the root.
If the root is an empty leaf node, then no data points are found.
If the root is a leaf containing a data record, then the location of
the data point is examined to determine if it falls within the
circle.
If the root is an internal node, then the process is performed
recursively, but <emphasis>only</emphasis> on those subtrees containing some part
of the search circle.</paragraph><paragraph>Let us now consider how the structure of the PR quadtree affects the
design of its node representation.
The PR quadtree is actually a <title_reference>trie</title_reference>.
Decomposition takes place at the mid-points for internal nodes,
regardless of where the data points actually fall.
The placement of the data points does determine <emphasis>whether</emphasis> a
decomposition for a node takes place, but not <emphasis>where</emphasis> the
decomposition for the node takes place.
Internal nodes of the PR quadtree are quite different from leaf nodes,
in that internal nodes have children (leaf nodes do not) and leaf
nodes have data fields (internal nodes do not).
Thus, it is likely to be beneficial to represent internal nodes
differently from leaf nodes.
Finally, there is the fact that approximately half of the leaf nodes
will contain no data field.</paragraph><paragraph>Another issue to consider is: How does a routine traversing the
PR quadtree get the coordinates for the square represented by the
current PR quadtree node?
One possibility is to store with each node its spatial description
(such as upper-left corner and width).
However, this will take a lot of space  perhaps as much as the
space needed for the data records, depending on what information is
being stored.</paragraph><paragraph>Another possibility is to pass in the coordinates when the recursive
call is made.
For example, consider the search process.
Initially, the search visits the root node of the tree, which has
origin at (0, 0), and whose width is the full size of the space being
covered.
When the appropriate child is visited, it is a simple matter for the
search routine to determine the origin for the child, and the width of
the square is simply half that of the parent.
Not only does passing in the size and position information for a node
save considerable space, but avoiding storing such information
in the nodes enables a good design choice for
empty leaf nodes, as discussed next.</paragraph><paragraph>How should we represent empty leaf nodes?
On average, half of the leaf nodes in a PR quadtree are empty
(i.e., do not store a data point).
One implementation option is to use a NULL pointer in internal
nodes to represent empty nodes.
This will solve the problem of excessive space requirements.
There is an unfortunate side effect that using a NULL pointer requires
the PR quadtree processing methods to understand this convention.
In other words, you are breaking encapsulation on the node
representation because the tree now must know things about how the
nodes are implemented.
This is not too horrible for this particular application, because the
node class can be considered private to the tree class, in which case
the node implementation is completely invisible to the outside world.
However, it is undesirable if there is another reasonable alternative.</paragraph><paragraph>Fortunately, there is a good alternative.
It is called the <title_reference>Flyweight</title_reference> <title_reference>design pattern</title_reference>.
In the PR quadtree, a flyweight is a single empty leaf node that
is reused in all places where an empty leaf node is needed.
You simply have <emphasis>all</emphasis> of the internal nodes with empty leaf
children point to the same node object.
This node object is created once at the beginning of the program,
and is never removed.
The node class recognizes from the pointer value that the flyweight is
being accessed, and acts accordingly.</paragraph><paragraph>Note that when using the Flyweight design pattern, you <emphasis>cannot</emphasis>
store coordinates for the node in the node.
This is an example of the concept of intrinsic versus extrinsic state.
Intrinsic state for an object is state information stored in the object.
If you stored the coordinates for a node in the node object, those
coordinates would be intrinsic state.
Extrinsic state is state information about an object stored elsewhere
in the environment, such as in global variables or passed to the
method.
If your recursive calls that process the tree pass in the coordinates
for the current node, then the coordinates will be extrinsic state.
A flyweight can have in its intrinsic state <emphasis>only</emphasis>
information that is accurate for <emphasis>all</emphasis> instances of the
flyweight.
Clearly coordinates do not qualify, because each empty
leaf node has its own location.
So, if you want to use a flyweight, you must pass in coordinates.</paragraph><paragraph>Another design choice is: Who controls the work, the node
class or the tree class?
For example, on an insert operation, you could have the tree class
control the flow down the tree, looking at (querying) the nodes to see
their type and reacting accordingly.
This is the typical approach used by the BST implementation.
An alternate approach is to have the node class do the work.
That is, you have an insert method for the nodes.
If the node is internal, it passes the city record to the appropriate
child (recursively).
If the node is a flyweight, it replaces itself with a new leaf node.
If the node is a full node, it replaces itself with a subtree.
This is an example of the <title_reference>Composite design pattern</title_reference>.
Use of the composite design would be difficult if NULL pointers are
used to represent empty leaf nodes.
It turns out that the PR quadtree insert and delete methods are easier
to implement when using the composite design.</paragraph></document>
