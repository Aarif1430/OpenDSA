philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist, orator, essayist, and author.
He is considered one of the fathers of modern science and of the scientific method.</paragraph><paragraph>His scientific method was put forward in his book <emphasis>Nova Organum</emphasis>
(New Method), and was designed to replace the methods put forward
in Aristotle's original works on logic from around 350 BCE.
This New Method strongly influenced the development of the scientific method
in modern science .</paragraph><paragraph>His method distinguishes itself from the approach set down by Aristotle
and his disciples, which had been followed by scientists for nearly 2,000 years.
The Aristotelian approach favored exploring scientific problems through
the application of logic, discussion, and rhetoric.
In contrast, Bacon proposed an approach based on inductive reasoning
supported by evidence.</paragraph><paragraph>Bacon also listed what he called the 'idols of the mind'.
He described four types of <emphasis>false images</emphasis>
things which obstructed the path of correct scientific reasoning.</paragraph><field_list><field><field_name>Idols of the Tribe</field_name><field_body><paragraph>The tendency to perceive more order and regularity in systems
