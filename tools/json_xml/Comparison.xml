decide which one is bigger.
How do we compare two things?
If all that we wanted to sort or search for was simple integer values,
this would not be an interesting question.
We can just use standard comparison operators like "&lt;" or "&gt;".
Even if we wanted to store strings, most programming languages give us
built-in functions for comparing strings alphabetically.
But we do not usually want to store just integers or strings in a data
structure.
Usually we want to store records, where a record is made up of
multiple values, such as a name, an address, and a phone number.
In that case, how can we "compare" records to decide which one is
"smaller"?
We cannot just use "&lt;" to compare the records!
Nearly always in this situation, we actually are interested in sorting
the records based on the values of one particular field used to
represent the record,
which itself is something simple like an integer.
This field is referred to as the <title_reference>key</title_reference> for the record.</paragraph><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><index>null</index></raw><paragraph>Likewise, if we want to search for a given record in a database, how
should we describe what we are looking for?
A database record could simply be a number, or it could be quite
complicated, such as a payroll record with many fields of varying
types.
We do not want to describe what we are looking for by detailing and
matching the entire contents of the record.
If we knew everything about the record already, we probably would not
need to look for it.
Instead, we typically define what record we want in terms of a
key value.
For example, if searching for payroll records, we might wish to
search for the record that matches a particular ID number.
In this example the ID number is the <title_reference>search key</title_reference>.</paragraph><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><index>null</index></raw><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><index>null</index></raw><paragraph>To implement sorting or searching, we require that keys be <title_reference>comparable</title_reference>.
At a minimum, we must be able to take two keys and reliably determine
whether they are equal or not.
That is enough to enable a sequential search through a database of
records and find one that matches a given key.
However, we typically would like for the keys to define a
<title_reference>total order &lt;total order&gt; &lt;SetDef&gt;</title_reference>,
which means that we can always tell which of two keys is greater than
the other.
Using key types with total orderings gives the database
implementor the opportunity to organize a collection of records in
a way that makes searching more efficient.
An example is storing the records in sorted order in an array, which
permits a binary search.
Fortunately, in practice most fields of most records consist of
simple data types with natural total orders.
For example, integers, floats, doubles, and character strings all are
totally ordered.</paragraph><paragraph>But if we want to write a general purpose sorting or searching
function, we need a general way to get the key for the record.
We could insist that every record have a particular method called
<literal>.key()</literal>.
That seems like a good name for it!</paragraph><paragraph>Some languages like Java and C++ have special infrastructure for
supporting this (such as the <literal>Comparable</literal> interface in Java,
which has the <literal>.compareTo()</literal> method for defining the exact process
by which two objects are compared).
But many languages like Processing and JavaScript do not.</paragraph><paragraph>But what if the programmer had already used that method name for
another purpose?
An even bigger problem is, what if the programmer wants to sort the
record now using one field as the key, and later using another field?
Or search sometimes on one key, and at other times on another?
The problem is that the "keyness" of a given field is not an inherent
property within the record, but rather depends on the context.
So, you cannot always count on being able to use your favorite method
name (or even the comparable interface) to extract the desired key
value.</paragraph><definition_list><definition_list_item><term>Another, more general approach is to supply a function or class</term><definition><paragraph>called a <title_reference>comparator</title_reference></paragraph></definition></definition_list_item></definition_list><paragraph>whose job is to extract the key from the record.
A comparator function can be passed in as a parameter, such as in a
call to a sorting function.
In this case, the comparator function would be invoked on two records
whenever they need to be compared.
In this way, different comparator functions can be passed in to handle
different record types or different fields within a record.
In Java (with generics) or C++ (with templates), a comparator class
can be a parameter for another class definition.
For example, a BST could take a comparator class as a generics
parameter in Java.
This comparator class would be responsible for dealing with the
comparison of two records.</paragraph><paragraph>Unfortunately, while flexible and able to handle nearly all
situations, there are a few situations for which it is not possible to
write a key extraction method.
In that case, a comparator will not work. <footnote_reference auto="1" ids="id2" refid="id3">1</footnote_reference></paragraph><paragraph>One good general-purpose solution is to explicitly store
<title_reference>key-value pairs &lt;key-value pair&gt;</title_reference> in the data structure.
For example, if we want to sort a bunch of records, we can store them
in an array where every array entry contains both a key value for the
record and a pointer to the record itself.
This might seem like a lot of extra space required, but remember that
we can then store pointers to the records in another array with
another field as the key for another purpose.
The records themselves do not need to be duplicated.
A simple class for representing key-value pairs is shown here.</paragraph><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><codeinclude>null</codeinclude></raw><paragraph>The main places where we will need to be concerned with comparing
records and extracting keys is for various <title_reference>dictionary</title_reference>
implementations and sorting algorithms.
To keep them clear and simple, visualizations for sorting algorithms
will usually show them as operating on integer values stored in an
array.
But almost never do people really want to sort an array of integers.
But to be useful, a real sorting algorithm typically has to
deal with the fact that it is sorting a collection of records.
A general-purpose sorting routine meant to operate on multiple record
types would have to be written in a way to deal with the generic
comparison problem.
To illustrate, here is an example of
<title_reference>Insertion Sort &lt;Insertion Sort&gt; &lt;InsertionSort&gt;</title_reference> implemented to
work on an array that stores records that support the <literal>Comparable</literal>
interface.
Note that since <literal>KVPair</literal> is implemented to implement the
<literal>Comparable</literal> interface, an array of <literal>KVPair</literal> could be used by this
sort function.</paragraph><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><codeinclude>null</codeinclude></raw><paragraph>Here are some review questions to test your knowledge from this module.</paragraph><raw format="xml" xml:space="preserve"><avembed

function that extracts a key from a record is when we have a
collection of records that describe books in a library.
One of the fields for such a record might be a list of subject
keywords, where the typical record stores a few keywords.
Our dictionary might be implemented as a list of records sorted
by keyword.
If a book contains three keywords, it would appear three times
on the list, once for each associated keyword.
However, given the record, there is no simple way to determine
which keyword on the keyword list triggered this appearance of
the record.
Thus, we cannot write a function that extracts the key from
such a record.</paragraph></footnote></document>
