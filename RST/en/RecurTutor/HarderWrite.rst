How to write a more sophisticated recursive function?
=====================================================

In the previous examples and exercises, all the recursive functions has only one base case and one recursive case. A more general structure for recursion
can have more than one base case and recursive case. 

The following Figure shows how a general structure recursive function looks like.

In some problems, we need to have more than one base case and more than one recursive case. For example, the fibonacci function and the operations done on a tree structure like tree traversal.

You need to practice harder recursive functions in order to gain more experience on recursion.
