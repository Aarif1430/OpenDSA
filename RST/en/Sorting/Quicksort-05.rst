Quicksort-05
============

Here is a visualization for the entire Quicksort algorithm.
This visualization shows you how the logical decomposition caused by
the partitioning process works.
In the visualization, the separate sub-partitions are separated out to
match the recursion tree.
In reality, there is only a single array involved (as you will see in
the proficiency exercise that follows the visualization).
