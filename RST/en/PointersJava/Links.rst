Link Nodes
----------

In this module, we introduce the idea of a :term:`link node`.
This has some sort of value field, and a pointer to another link
node.
Later, you will learn about :term:`linked lists <linked list>`,
which are made from link nodes.
For now, we will just use them as a simple way to connect some objects
together.

Here is a class definition for a link object.

.. TODO::
   :type: Code

   Code here for link nodes.

Here are some exercises to practice manipulating link nodes.
