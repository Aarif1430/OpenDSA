Binary Trees Chapter Introduction
=================================

:term:`Tree <tree>` structures enable efficient access and efficient
update to large collections of data.
:term:`Binary trees <binary tree>` in particular are widely used and
relatively easy to implement.
But binary trees are useful for many things besides searching.
Just a few examples of applications that trees can speed up include
prioritizing jobs, describing mathematical expressions and the
syntactic elements of computer programs,
or organizing the information needed to drive data compression
algorithms.

This chapter covers terminology used for discussing binary trees,
tree traversals, approaches to implementing tree :term:`nodes <node>`,
and various examples of binary trees.
