Functional Programming - Part 7 (F 2/26/16)
===========================================

RP 12 part 1
------------

Topics of the day:

  1. Continuations
  2. Continuation-passing style programming

The review problem set for today contains five review problems.

This first problem is about a recursive function to compute the
greatest common divisor (or :math:`gcd`) of two integers.

RP 12 part 2
------------

This review problem is the first one in a sequence of three problems
that require you to complete the implementation of a recursive
function that uses continuation-passing style programming. This
problem use the :math:`gcd` function introduced in the first problem
in this set, but you do not need to remember how it was implemented,
just what it computes.
