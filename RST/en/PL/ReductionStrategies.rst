RP 17 Part 1
------------

This problem focuses on the first step (i.e., :math:`\beta`-reduction)
in the evaluation of a :math:`\lambda`-expression with the two
evaluation strategies that we discussed. To get credit for this
randomized exercise, you must solve it correctly three times in a row.

RP 17 Part 2
------------

In this problem, you have to study the complete evaluation of a
:math:`\lambda`-expression with the two evaluation strategies that we
discussed. To get credit for this randomized exercise, you must solve
it correctly three times in a row.

RP 17 Part 3
------------

In this problem, you have to perform a full evaluation of a randomly
selected :math:`\lambda` expression, that is, perform as many
:math:`\beta`-reductions as it takes until a :math:`\beta`-normal form
is reached. For this problem, you must use the *applicative-order*
reduction strategy. To get credit for this problem, you only need to
solve it correctly once. However, each problem instance contains several
steps that you must perform correctly (in this case, each step is a
:math:`\beta`-reduction).

RP 17 Part 4
------------

In this problem, you have to perform a full evaluation of a randomly
selected :math:`\lambda` expression, that is, perform as many
:math:`\beta`-reductions as it takes until a :math:`\beta`-normal form is
reached. For this problem, you must use the *normal-order*
reduction strategy.
