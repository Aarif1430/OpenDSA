Reduction Strategies

RP 17 Part 1
------------

This problem focuses on the first step (i.e., :math:`\beta`-reduction)
in the evaluation of a :math:`\lambda`-expression with the two
evaluation strategies that we discussed. To get credit for this
randomized exercise, you must solve it correctly three times in a row.

RP 17 Part 2
------------

In this problem, you have to study the complete evaluation of a
:math:`\lambda`-expression with the two evaluation strategies that we
discussed. To get credit for this randomized exercise, you must solve
it correctly three times in a row.
