Can WebGL animations be displayed in an OpenDSA book?

Testing WebGL Graphics in OpenDSA
---------------------------------

This module is a proof-of-concept test to see whether we can use WebGL
instead of JSAV to put animations into an OpenDSA book.


In the demonstration below, you can use the "Rotate" buttons to control the axis on which the color-cube accumulates additional rotations (by 2 degrees each time the frame is updated).   If you want to explore what the accumulated rotations do without the continual rotation, just click the "Toggle" button
