===========================================

RP 14 part 1
------------

Topics of the day:

  1. Syntax of the lambda calculus
  2. Free and bound variables
  3. Semantics of the lambda calculus

The review problem set for today contains four review problems.

This first problem is about the structure (or syntax) of
:math:`\lambda` expressions. Since it is a randomized problem, you
need to solve it correctly three times in a row to get credit for it.
