Class 2: Presentation
=====================

OpenDSA Classroom Use
---------------------

*  Virginia Tech CS3:

   *  Fall 2012/Spring 2013 (sorting, hashing): 200 students
   *  Fall 2013, Spring 2014, Fall 2014 (full semester): 500 students

      I found that I could spend much less time on "procedural"
      aspects of various algorithms, and more on deeper concepts
      (analysis) or on programming issues.

*  Virginia Tech CS2:

   *  Spring, Summer, Fall 2014, Spring 2015: 250 students
   *  Linear structures, simple sorts, binary trees intro
   *  Some experimentation with "flipped classroom"

*  Virginia Tech Senior/Graduate algorithms:

   * Spring 2015, 60 students (NP Completeness)

*  University of Alexandria, Egypt CS3:

   * Spring 2013, 25 students

*  Beloit College CS3:

   *  Spring 2014, Spring 2015: 30 students

*  New York University CS2:

   *  Spring 2014: 80 students

*  Aalto University, Finland CS3:

   *  Spring 2013, Fall 2014

*  UTEP CS3

   *  Fall 2014, 50 students

*  Linkoping, Sweden CS3:

   *  Fall 2014, 130 students

*  Florida International University CS2/3

   *  Fall 2014, 80 students

*  Valparaiso U CS3

   *  Spring 2015, 30 students

*  Christopher Newport U CS3

   *  Spring 2015, 70 students


Log Data Collection and Results
-------------------------------

We log all user interactions (mouse clicks, pages visited, timestamps,
exercises completed, slides viewed, window focus/unfocus, etc.)

Goals:

*  Learn about effective/ineffective exercises (time spent, use for
   study practice, etc.)
*  Learn about general system behavior (to see what is effective, what
   aspects are "gamed")
*  Learn patterns of use like time distribution, whether OpenDSA used
   to study

We also collect a lot of survey data.


Examples
--------

Question: Do students want the "gamification" feedback?

   Gamification: Survey data.


Question: Do students try to "game" the system by reading the hints to get the
question answers for later?

   Hints vs. fraction of incorrect answers


Question: Do students view the "model" answers in the proficiency exercises?

Some other questions:

*  Do students spend enough time on Recursion? (instructor surveys)
*  Do we have proper coverage on key topics like recursion?
   (instructor surveys, Concept Inventory process)
