=====================

Instructor's tools
------------------

OpenDSA has basic support to let instructors:

*  create assignments
*  track student progress (gradebook)

**Caveat:** All of this is going to change by Spring 2016
(possibly by Fall 2015).

*  By then we will be implementing using LTI with integration into
   various standard LMS sytems (first target is Canvas).

For details on the current system, see:

*  `Examples <http://algoviz.org/OpenDSA/instructors.html>`_
*  `Documentation <http://opendsa.readthedocs.org/en/latest/InstructorTools.html>`_


Configuring a book instance
---------------------------

OpenDSA textbook instances are compiled from configuration files.

*  Select written and programming language(s)
*  Select modules
*  Configure exercises
*  There are some controls over whether given sections are included or
   not.

Look at the
`configuration file <https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/blob/master/config/C2GEN.json>`_
for the book instance that you are
looking at right now.
