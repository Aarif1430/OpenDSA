Overview
--------

Today I will talk about what OpenDSA is:

* A collection of materials
* That can be compiled into book instances
* Visualization + Exercises (automatically assessed)
* This is ideal for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
* Works for other areas of CS (FLA, PL materials in development)
* Potentially useful in other domains (most obviously math & stat)
