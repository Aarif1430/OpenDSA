Class 1: Introduction
=====================

Here I will talk about what OpenDSA is:

* A collection of materials
* That can be compiled into book instances
* Visualization + Exercises (automatically assessed)
* This is ideal for DSA
* Works for other areas of CS (FLA, PL)
* Potentially useful in other domains (most obviously math & stat)
