Tree Exercises
==============

A place to put exercises that don't have anywhere better for now.

.. todo::

   Exercise:

   Given: A tree generated at random (constrained so that the
   probabilities work out reasonably).

   Question: Does this tree meet the BST property? Does it meet the
   min-heap property? Neither? Both? (show these as four choices.)

.. todo::

   More questions (short/MC):

   Is a heap a binary tree? (Yes, logically)

   Are heaps implemented using trees? (not usually)

   Is a binary tree a search tree? (No. Binary tree is just a
   structural property)

.. todo::

   Proficiency exercise: Insert a value into a heap. This is a bit
   different from the current binaryheap-insert-proficiency.html in
   that it should be possible to insert it in a way that violates the
   shape property. In the current version, the shape is given. The
   current one also shows the array along with the tree. Need to pick
   some of these issues apart?
