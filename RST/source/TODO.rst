TODO
====

* [Shellsort] Write the first exercise. This requires figuring out how
  to pass interface interactions on to JSAV when inside a KA exercise class.
* [Shellsort] The array elements could be a few pixels smaller, at least in
  the vertical direction
* [Shellsort] Fix up the default speed for animation
* Try out cross-referencing (with numbers)
* Figure out how to keep Glossary and Bibliography from getting
  numbered as sections (and also TODO, but that should go away soon).
