Preface

**Welcome to OpenDSA!**
The OpenDSA project hopes to eventually make available online the
course materials for a full semester Data Structures and Algorithms
course.
For this semester, we will be using OpenDSA for Sorting and Hashing.
Your OpenDSA "textbook" is made up of a series of modules.
Each module corresponds to roughly one section in the textbook.
OpenDSA content includes textbook quality text and images, combined
with algorithm visualizations for all of the algorithms, and lots of
assessment exercises so that you can tell if you really know what you
have been reading.

**Supported browsers:** We support any reasonably recent version of
Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
Unfortunately, we do not attempt to support Internet Explorer, and we
can pretty well guarentee that it won't work there.

**Registration and Accounts:**
To get credit for completing exercises and modules, you will need to
be logged in.
First you should register an account.
You can use any name and password for your account, but we ask that
you use your Virginia Tech PID for you account name.
That will let us give you appropriate course credit for what you have
done.

Registration is simple, just click on the Registration link and fill
out the form.
Once you register, you will need to then click the "Login" button.
Once you log in, you should see your account name in the upper left
corner.
You can log out by clicking on the logout link.
You don't really need to do that unless you want another person to be
able to use the same computer to also access the OpenDSA materials
under another account.

**Overview of major elements:**
An OpenDSA module contains a number of interactive components to help
you learn the material, in addition to regular text and graphics.
There are short slideshows that illustrate a small part of an
algorithm to help with the explanation,
there are full Algorithm Visualizations that go through an example of
the algorithm from start to finish,
there are "proficiency exercises" where you demonstrate
proficiency with an exercise by showing the steps, and there are sets
of questions.

**Getting credit:**
You can get completion credit for the following:
Going through a slideshow, completing a proficiency exercise, or
completing a question set.
You must be logged in to get credit.
If you go through the exercise and *then* log in, you should then be
given credit.

**Slideshows:**
You get credit for a slideshow just for progressing to the end.
A green checkmark should show up when you get credit.

**Multiple Choice Question Sets:** Most modules have an exercise which is
a collection of multiple choice, True/False, or type-a-number
questions.
To get credit for one of these exercises, you will have to correctly
answer some number of questions in a row (the exact number required is
different for each exercise).
Once you have credit, the button above the exercise turns green.
You can still get more questions at that point if you would like more
practice.
There is also a "streak" bar that shows your current progress.
If you answer a question wrong, your progress toward the completion
streak is reset to the beginning.
Note that once you have been given credit for the exercise, you cannot
lose it by answering more questions.

The multiple choice question sets work by randomly selecting from a
set of questions in that set. It is possible that you will see the
same question twice in that set, and possibly even twice in a row.

Some of the questions have "hints" that you can ask for to help you
figure out the answer.
If you ask a hint, you will not get credit for that question toward
completing the exercise.
However, you will not get your progress on the current streak set
back, either.

Note that we have two types of thing that we call a "proficiency
exercise", and sometimes the distinction can become confusing.
Anything where you are clicking on arrays or other graphical elements
to simulate the steps of an algorithm might be referred to as a
"proficiency exercise".
The small ones have an interface similar to the question banks,
where you must do several in a row correctly to get credit for the
full exercise, just like the question banks.
The larger ones have a different interface and a different credit
system.

**Proficiency Exercises:**
Full proficiency exercises are graded on a point system.
Each step that you do in the exercise gives you a point.
You need to get some fraction of the total possible points to complete
the exercise.
Generally, if you make a mistake on a proficiency exercise, it will
tell you that you did the step wrong and correct it for you so that
you can continue on. You will not get credit for that particular step
when you do it wrong, but you can get credit for the remaining steps.
Once you complete the proficiency exercise correctly, the button above
it will turn green.
