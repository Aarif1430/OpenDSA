      "sc1": "Let's consider a simple recursive function to sum the elements of an array.",
      "sc2": "Assume the array contains [2, 4, 6], and that the function is called as sum(arr, 3). This will sum the first three elements of the array. We will stack up the data passed on the calls on the left side.",
      "sc3": "On the initial call, the base case is not true (since n is not 0).",
      "sc4": "The recursive call is made, passing a value of n$-1=2$, and a reference to the array.",
      "sc5": "The original sum makes a call to sum, passing in a copy of arr. Notice that n has a value of 2.",
      "sc6": "Here's the important question, to see if you're keeping up. How many n's are there? One or two? Recall that n is a value parameter. Because it is a value parameter, that means it's a copy. Thus, it occupies a different memory location.",
      "sc7": "In the second call, n is 2, which means we aren't at the base case yet. So, it again goes to the recursive call ...",
      "sc8": "... which gives us a third copy of n.",
      "sc9": "We are still  not at the base case, so we must make another recursive call.",
      "sc10":"At this point, we are at the base case. So, the value of 0 is returned.",
      "sc11":"The result returned is added to the value in arr[n - 1]. Since n is now 1 , arr[n - 1] is arr[1 - 1], which is arr[0] = 2. So, add 0 + 2.", 
      "sc12":"This is why it's important to return 0 from the base case. We add 0 to the value at array element 0. Now 2 is returned back to the previous call.",
      "sc13":"Now 2 is added to arr[n - 1] = arr[2 - 1] = arr[1] = 4. So, 2 + 4 is 6, and that is returned back.",
      "sc14":"Finally, 6  will be added to arr[n - 1] = arr[3 - 1] = arr[2] = 6, which is 12.",
      "sc15": "So 12 is the final result of the call. That is the answer that we expect."
