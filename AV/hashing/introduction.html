  Hashing is a method for storing and retrieving records from a database.
  It lets you insert, delete, and search for records based on a search
  key value. When properly implemented, these operations can be performed
  in constant time. In fact, a properly tuned hash system typically looks at only 
  one or two records for each search, insert, or delete operation. This is far better 
  than the O(log <i>n</i>) average cost required to do a binary search on a sorted array of 
  <i>n</i> records, or the O(log <i>n</i>) average cost required to do an operation 
  on a binary search tree. However, even though hashing is based on a very simple idea, it is 
  surprisingly difficult to implement properly. Designers need to pay careful attention to all 
  of the details involved with implementing a hash system.
  </p>
  
	<p>
	A hash system stores records in an array called a <b>hash table</b>,
	which we will call <b>HT</b>.
	Hashing works by performing a computation on a search key
	<i>K</i> in a way that is intended to identify the position in
	<b>HT</b> that contains the record with key <i>K</i>.
	The function that does this calculation is called the
	<b>hash function</b>, and will be denoted by the letter <b>h</b>.
	Since hashing schemes place records in the table in whatever order
	satisfies the needs of the address calculation, records are
	not ordered by value.
	A position in the hash table is also known as a <b>slot</b>.
	The number of slots in hash table <b>HT</b> will be denoted by the
	variable <i>M</i> with slots numbered from 0 to <i>M</i> - 1.
	</p>

	<p>
	The goal for a hashing system is to arrange things such that, for any key
	value <i>K</i> and some hash function <b>h</b>,
	<i>i</i> = <b>h</b>(<i>K</i>) is a slot in the table such that
	0 &lt;= <i>i</i> &lt; <i>M</i>,
	and we have the key of the record stored at
	<b>HT</b>[<i>i</i>] equal to <i>K</i>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Hashing is not good for applications where multiple
	records with the same key value are permitted.
	Hashing is not a good method for answering range searches.
	In other words, we cannot easily find all records (if any) whose key
	values fall within a certain range.
	Nor can we easily find the record with the minimum or maximum key
	value, or visit the records in key order.
	Hashing is most appropriate for answering the question, ``What record,
	if any, has key value <i>K</i>?''
	<b>For applications where all search is done by exact-match queries,
	hashing is the search method of choice because it is extremely
	efficient when implemented correctly.</b>
	As this tutorial shows, however, there are many approaches
	to hashing and it is easy to devise an inefficient implementation.
	Hashing is suitable for both in-memory and disk-based searching and
	is one of the two most widely used methods for organizing large
	databases stored on disk (the other is the B-tree).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As a simple (though unrealistic) example of hashing,
	consider storing <i>n</i> records, each with a unique key value in the
	range 0 to <i>n</i>-1.
	A record with key <i>k</i> can be stored in
	<b>HT</b>[<i>k</i>], and so the hash function is
	<b>h</b>(<i>k</i>) = <i>k</i>.
	To find the record with key value <i>k</i>, look in
	<b>HT</b>[<i>k</i>].
	</p>

	<p> Select a table size, and enter some numbers. They will be inserted into the hash table 
	using the hash function h(k) = k.
