Create a boolean array indexed through n
Set indices 0 and 1 to false.  All others to true
Initially, let p equal 2, the smallest prime number
"Sift" multiples of p, starting at 2*p, by setting them to false
Find the first index greater than p in the array that is true
    If there as no such index, stop
    Otherwise, let p = this and repeat from step 4
Upon termination, the indexes that remain true are all the primes <= n
